This package is add-on feature for Unitycar 2.0->.
!!! REQUIRES Unitycar 2.x Vehicle Physics Package TO WORK !!!

It is possible to get this package to work with older version of Unitycar but
it requires few changes to the Display Control script, mainly removing fuel level parts.
In this case Unity usually tells you if something is missing so it's just
needed to comment out those lines (//).


You should use prefab's to set up your displays.
Currently theres two displays included (RD-01 and RD-02).

There is a Laptimer script included but it's just an template script, placeholder.
You should adjust the few lines in Display Control script to use your own laptimer script.

Display Control script is also looking for GameObject tagged with 'FuelTank' to get the fuel level value.
Also the control script is looking for GameObject tagged with'LevelController' where the Laptimer script is located.

So basically you should do:
- Add tag's FuelTank and LevelController to you scene.
- Create empty gameobject and assign it with tag LevelController, add template Laptimer script.
- Create cube gameobject, place it inside your car, assign with tag FuelTank, add Unitycar's fueltank script.

---------------------------------------
How to get the display to work with your car:

1. Edit Unitycar's CarController.cs script's 'veloKmh' value. Replace 'float veloKmh' with 'public float veloKmh' 
2. Add wanted display prefab to your scene.
3. Rotate and place it inside your cars cockpit
4. Assign your car to the display control script (Car transform instance)

Display's should be matching 'real' display dimensions but you can scale them freely to match your game scales.

---------------------------------------

Could be that I missed something out but I'm sure Unity tells you if somethings missing or wrong.

If you can't get it working properly let me know so we can fix it.
